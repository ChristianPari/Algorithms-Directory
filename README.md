# Problem Solving Directory
## [Java](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Java-Problem-Solving) - [JavaScript](https://github.com/ChristianPari/JavaScript-Problem-Solving) - [Python](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Python-Problem-Solving)
Simple directory to direct the viewer to language based repos they desire to see.
Each of these repos contain challenges solved using:
  - Algorithms to help me learn their use cases and best practices, as well as understanding time and space complexities
  - Data Structures like Maps, Dictionaries, Queues, Stacks, and so on to learn their methods and functionalities

I will point out that the beginning of my problem solving journey in coding I was very unaware of how algorithms and data structures, as well as dynamic programming would effect my solving ability so I mainly solved problems through breaking down the problem into smaller ones and finding the best way I could to execute them efficiently.

My determination to solve a problem carriers over into my now growing knowledge of these more crucial programming ideas and my goal is to always find a solution, no matter how ugly at first, becuase there is always room for improvement.
